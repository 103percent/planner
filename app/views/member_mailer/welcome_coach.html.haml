    The success of our workshops depends on coaches attending.
  If you accept an invitation but can't make it any more, please let us know
  %strong
    as soon as possible
  so we can allocate your place to someone on the waiting list. If you take a place
  on the waiting list, please keep that evening free and check your emails frequently.
  You will be notified at least three hours before the event if you receive a place.

  Our workshops start with around 30 minutes of socialising with food, before we assign
  you to coach one or two students. They'll either be working on

  or looking for help with their own project. Don't worry if you're not an expert on
  the topics - your role is not about having all the answers! Guiding a student through
  solving their own problem is more useful in the long run. There are more

  the workshop. They'll be at a table with the name stickers. They're there to help
  with anything on your mind.
