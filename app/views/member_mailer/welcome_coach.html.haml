    We send out invitations to our events via email.

    to receive invites to our weekly workshops.
  Places are limited, so be sure to respond quickly if you want to attend.

    The success of our workshops depends on coaches attending.
  If you accept an invitation but can't make it any more, please let us know
  %strong
    as soon as possible
  so we can allocate your place to someone on the waiting list. If you take a place
  on the waiting list, please keep that evening free and watch your email like a hawk
  on the day of the event. The waiting list will automatically upgrade you to 'attending'
  if someone else drops out.

%p
  Our workshops start with around 30 minutes of socialising and food, before we assign
  you to a coach with one or two other students. You can either work through
  = link_to "one of our tutorials", "http://tutorials.codebar.io/"
  or get help with your own project. After 2 hours of coaching, we retire to a nearby
  pub for some post-Codebar relaxation.

%p
  It's important to us that our workshops are a welcoming &amp; accepting environment
  for everyone. Please make sure you
  = link_to "read our code of conduct", attendance_policy_url
  before attending.

%p
  If you have any questions, reply to this email or chat to one of the organisers at
  the workshop. We'll be at the table with the name stickers. We're here to help
  with anything on your mind.

%p
  We hope to see you at a workshop soon!
