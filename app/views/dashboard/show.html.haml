      Our Goal

    %p.lead
      Making tech more diverse and welcoming by bringing people together and helping teach programming skills. We organize free sessions in HTML, CSS, Javascript and Ruby, targeted at different groups of people that are underrepresented in the tech industry. All these, with the help of our <b>amazing</b> coaches!
