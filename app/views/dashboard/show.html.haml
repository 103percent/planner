            %p I have benefitted from learning how to code in so many ways, not only in breaking things down and thinking them through logically but also through creating interesting projects and realising the potential of what is possible through writing good code.

            %p I started attending Codebar to learn how to code an idea I had, but I ended up learning more than just the basics! I built my initial prototype in just a few weeks and have progressed far more than I thought I could. The best part about the workshops are the coaches, they are very patient and help you understand difficult concepts. Attending the weekly workshops has now given me the confidence to code any idea into a prototype – something I didn’t think I could do a year ago! Learning to code is an excellent skill to add to your repertoire and it enhances any career path. I would highly recommend Codebar to anyone, especially if you come from a non-technical background like me!

            %p Codebar is awesome! The atmosphere is excellent - everyone is really friendly and the coaches really want to help in any way they can. Coding alone in your room isn't great for when you get stuck and so meeting other coders at Codebar made me realise that others were struggling with the same problems that I was. This really helped boost my confidence, which is vital when learning a new subject. Thoroughly recommended.
